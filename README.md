# EduSphere

**EduSphere** is a full-featured microservice-based educational platform built with Spring Boot. It demonstrates real-world architecture with:

- Inter-service communication (REST)
- Resilience patterns (like circuit breakers and retries)
- API gateway routing
- Docker-based containerization
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and repository testing

## Status
This project **is under active development**. Structure and modules may change during development.

## Technologies

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Web
- Spring Cloud Gateway (planned)
- PostgreSQL (per-service database)
- Flyway (database migrations)
- H2 Database (for local unit testing only)
- AWS SDK v2 (for S3-compatible storage)
- MinIO (local S3-compatible object storage)
- Swagger / OpenAPI 3
- Maven
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Services

Metadata is stored in PostgreSQL via the ContentItem entity.

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /contents/upload` — Upload a file
- `GET /contents/download/{key}` — Download a file by key

## Scripts
### `build-and-run.sh`

Builds Docker images for all microservices and starts the system using Docker Compose.

```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```
Make sure Docker is running before executing this script.

### `stop-and-clean.sh`

Stops all running containers related to the project and removes their volumes. This is useful to reset the environment 
during development or troubleshooting.

```bash
./stop-and-clean.sh
```

### `stop-and-purge.sh`

Stops all running services, removes containers, images, and volumes used by the system.

```bash
./stop-and-clean.sh
```
Use this to fully clean and reset the Docker environment, including local images and data volumes.

## Test Coverage

- JUnit-based controller tests
- Repository tests using H2 and `@DataJpaTest`
- MockMvc tests for REST APIs
- Entity auditing tests

Further test scenarios planned (e.g., end-to-end, resilience)
